The goal of the game is to maximise the score attained by bursting the balls.
This is an arcade game where the player controls a metal player and uses it to land on and destroy
other flying balls constantly traversing the screen from left to right. On landing on the flying balls,
they disappear and the player gets launched upwards a little higher (Like Mario jumping on
enemies).

The world consists of a floor with a small semicircular pond and a trampoline. Flying balls of
different colours (yellow ball = 50 points, green ball = 25 points) will traverse the screen above the
ground at various random heights from left to right as well as from left to right. The balls are densely
 located so that its possible to destroy multiple balls using the boost obtained by destroying one. 
 Some of the flying balls have a rectangular slab attached at different angles, if the players lands on 
 these slopes he/she would be launched at an angle of reflection from the perpendicular to the slab 
 following the laws of reflection.From level 2 onwards a porcupines starts apperaring but stationary.
 From level 3 onward magnet starts appearing and disappearing on random times.
 From level 4 magnet starts appearing and disappearing randomly on either sides of the game which causes 
 the playerâ€™s motion to be influenced .
 In level 5 , spiked porcupines start moving if the player lands on loses his score by 50 and is relocated 
 to its starting point.
Level breakdown :::
Level 1 -> scores in range [0,200)
Level 2 -> scores in range [200,400)
Level 3 -> scores in range [400,600)
Level 4 -> scores in range [600,800)
Level 5 -> scores in range [800,1000)
subsequent Level -> scores greater than 1000
Player can be controlled using mouse or keyboard controls as described in the README.

# About the code

If you want to self-learn, I recommend going through the site and downloading their original code
https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/archive/master.zip

The build process is specified here http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-1-opening-a-window/

But it takes time to build and you might encounter errors since they build the libraries
